        <h3 style="color:violet;">A DOG NAMED BEANS</h3>
       <p>The images seen on this page are intended to give the viewer a glimpse into the life of a Great Pyreneese Dog named Beans. He was plucked from his mother at the tender age of 6 weeks. He was the cutest little dog I'd ever seen, and he quicky grew into one of the largest dogs I've ever seen. When he stands on his back feet to walk like a human, he is just under six feet tall! And he weighs in at around one-hundred and sixty pounds. He is now four years old and will be five come January. My baby is growing up so fast.</p>
       </p>
       <p>Beans, according to breed quailities, is would live his best life if he had been raised on a ranch or farm, and had been in charge of protecting the other animals and livestock. He is mostly nocturnal, doing his duty of guard dog. But instead of guarding other animals, he has become attached to his people, and therfore, he guards us. And because of his faithfullness in keeping us safe, he lives a rather lavish lifestyle. Besides being touched 24/7, his other favorite activity, or treatment he receives, is getting his giant head scratched with the rainbow head massager. It's terrifying at first, but then oh does it scrath his ears in all the right places. </p>
